# landing-page
## The Odin Project - Project: Landing Page 

### Assignment:
Create a landing page, that follows the specific layout and styles provided.  
The assignment tests practical understanding of HTML, CSS and the flexbox model.

### Result:
I recreated the page as close as possible to the original design, but did add a little flair.
I changed the copy and added some real URLs which open on a different window and some hover effects.

### Notables:
All the content remains centered with a max with of 1440px.
Responsive layout without @media queries.
For flair, I've added some hove effects.
Copy was altered to fit the developer theme, but it is all fictious. 
Links are real.
